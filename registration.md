# Optimisation-based registration

## General problem

Most classical registration software cast the problem as optimising (let's say minimising) a functional of the form

$$
\mathcal{L} = \underbrace{\mathcal{S}\left(\mathbf{f}, g\circ\boldsymbol\phi ~\mid~ \boldsymbol\theta\right)}\_{\text{similarity}} ~~~+ \underbrace{\mathcal{R}(\boldsymbol\theta)}\_{\text{regularity}} ~.
$$

## Flavoured Gradient Descent

To simplify things, let us keep only references to $\boldsymbol\theta$, since that's what we optimise for:

$$
\mathcal{L}\left(\boldsymbol\theta\right) = \mathcal{S}\left(\boldsymbol\theta\right) + \mathcal{R}(\boldsymbol\theta) ~.
$$

In 99% of the cases, the regulariser is actually quadratic in the parameters, so we have 

$$
 \mathcal{R}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol\theta^{\mathrm{T}}\mathbf{R}\boldsymbol\theta ~~~~\text{with}~~~~ \mathbf{R} \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K} ~.
$$

Classically finite-difference-based regularisation is used, in which case (assuming circulant boundary conditions), the matrix $\mathbf{R}$ is Toeplitz-circulant, and its inverse $\mathbf{R}^{-1}$ can be computed using Fourier transforms. Let us further note that the gradient and Hessian of the regularisation term are
- $\boldsymbol\nabla\mathcal{R}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \mathbf{R}\boldsymbol\theta$,
- $\mathcal{H}\mathcal{R}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \mathbf{R}$.

When it comes to the similarity term, let us also write its gradient and Hessian as
- $\boldsymbol\nabla\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \mathbf{g}_{\boldsymbol\theta}$,
- $\mathcal{H}\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \mathbf{H}_{\boldsymbol\theta}$.

> [!NOTE]
> In general the similarity is not quadratic in $\boldsymbol\theta$, so the gradient and Hessian both depend on the point at which they are evaluated in some unknown way.

Let's optimise! The simplest optimisation scheme is gradient descent with step size $\gamma$:

$$
\boldsymbol\theta^{\text{new}} = \boldsymbol\theta - \gamma\left(\mathbf{g}_{\boldsymbol\theta} + \mathbf{R}\boldsymbol\theta\right) ~.
$$

On the other end of the spectrum, if the Hessian of the similarity term is known, we can use [Newton-Raphson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization) (also known simply as _Newton's optimisation method_):

$$
\boldsymbol\theta^{\text{new}} = \boldsymbol\theta - \left(\mathbf{H}\_{\boldsymbol\theta} + \mathbf{R}\right)^{-1}\left(\mathbf{g}_{\boldsymbol\theta} + \mathbf{R}\boldsymbol\theta\right) ~.
$$

However, they both belong to the broader family of [preconditioned gradient descent methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preconditioner#Preconditioning_in_optimization), of the form

$$
\boldsymbol\theta^{\text{new}} = \boldsymbol\theta - \mathbf{P}\left(\mathbf{g}_{\boldsymbol\theta} + \mathbf{R}\boldsymbol\theta\right) ~,
$$

where $\mathbf{P}\_{\boldsymbol\theta}$ is known as the preconditioner. In Newton's case, the preconditioner changes at each step, with $\mathbf{P}\_{\boldsymbol\theta} = \left(\mathbf{H}\_{\boldsymbol\theta} + \mathbf{R}\right)^{-1}$, whereas in gradient descent, the preconditioner is fixed and $\mathbf{P} = \gamma\mathbf{I}_K$. [This chapter ](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/book/c-opt.pdf) in Jeff Fessler's unpublished textbook made me realise that most optimisation techniques are variants of preconditioned GD. Now, in general we don't know $\mathbf{H}\_{\boldsymbol\theta}$ (and even when we know it, it may not be the best choice). Designing a good optimiser therefore reduces to finding a good preconditioner, that is both efficient to compute&mdash;so that each step is computationaly efficient&mdash;and close enough to the true Hessian&mdash;so that each step is close to optimal in some sense.

## Preconditioners

Since the regulariser is quadratic, all preconditioners will have the shape $\mathbf{P} = \left(\mathbf{H}^{\text{approx}} + \mathbf{R}\right)$, where $\mathbf{H}^{\text{approx}}$ is some alternative to the true Hessian of the similarity term. In this section, we will focus on variants of $\mathbf{H}^{\text{approx}}$.

[Gauss-Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Newton_algorithm) is generally presented in the context of nonlinear least-squares optimisation. Keeping it general, let's assume that

$$
\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta)^{\mathbf{T}} \mathbf{W} \mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta)
$$

where $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times M}$ is a positive semi-definite matrix of mixing weights (generally diagonal) and $\mathcal{F} \in \mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}^K \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^M)$ is some nonlinear function. By application of the chain rule, its gradient and Hessian are
- $\boldsymbol\nabla\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \boldsymbol\nabla\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta)^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{W} \mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta)$.
- $\mathcal{H}\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \boldsymbol\nabla\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta)^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol\nabla\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta) + \sum_{m}\mathcal{H}\mathcal{F}_m(\boldsymbol\theta) \cdot \mathbf{w}_m^{\text{T}} \mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta)$.

Ths idea is that you're essentially discarding the second term of the Hessian, giving us the preconditioner

$$
\mathbf{H}^{\text{approx}} = \boldsymbol\nabla\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta)^{\mathrm{T}} \mathbf{W} \boldsymbol\nabla\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta)
$$

Discarding the second term of the Hessian derives from the use of [Fisher's scoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_algorithm), where the assumption $\boldsymbol\nabla\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \mathbf{0}$ is plugged back into the Hessian. In this case, this yields $\mathcal{F}(\boldsymbol\theta) = \mathbf{0}$ and therefore the nulling of the second term. One of its main advantages is that it is always positive semi-definite, even in cases when the true Hessian $\mathcal{H}\mathcal{S}(\boldsymbol\theta)$ is negative semi-definite (which can happen!).

One problem with Fisher's scoring is that the approximate Hessian can be _less positive-definite_ than the true Hessian. Before delving into it, let's better define what we mean by "more or less positive-definite".

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In optimisation, Loewner's order matters because, for a convex function $\mathcal{L}$, using a preconditioner whose inverse is more positive definite than all Hessians of $\mathcal{L}$ ensures that preconditioned gradient descent converges. If you're familiar with minimisation-maximisation framework, it's quite easy to see that with such a preconditioner the quadratic

[Levenberg-Marquardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm) simply consists of choosing a preconditioner that interpolates between gradient descent and Gauss-Newton. Their preconditioners are:
- $\mathbf{H}^{\text{Levenberg}} = \mathbf{H}^{\text{Fisher}} + \lambda \mathbf{I}$
- $\mathbf{H}^{\text{Marquardt}} = \mathbf{H}^{\text{Fisher}} + \lambda \text{diag}\left( \mathbf{H}^{\text{Fisher}} \right)$

Another preconditioner that sometimes work well (and sometimes doesn't) is the diagonal of the true Hessian (or the diagonal of Fisher's Hessian), _i.e_, $\mathbf{H}^{\text{Jacobi}} = \text{diag}(\mathbf{H})$. It is the preconditioner used in [Jacobi's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method) for diagonally-dominant systems.

Finally, in registration (on generally in regulatised problems), we may set $\mathbf{H}^{\text{approx}} = \mathbf{0}$, which means our preconditioner is the inverse of the regulariser:

$$
\mathbf{P}^{\text{Hilbert}} = \gamma\mathbf{R}^{-1}
$$

giving the update step

$$
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\text{new}} = \boldsymbol\theta - \gamma\mathbf{R}^{-1}\left(\mathbf{g}_{\boldsymbol\theta} + \mathbf{R}\boldsymbol\theta\right) = \boldsymbol\theta - \gamma\left(\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{g}\_{\boldsymbol\theta} + \boldsymbol\theta\right) = (1 - \gamma)\boldsymbol\theta  - \gamma\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{g}\_{\boldsymbol\theta} ~.
$$

These Hilbert gradients were introduced in [Beg et al. (2005)&mdash;section 6.1](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ede22f3682bc33b361f5c67a17476a46ea3d3f4c). Interestingly, only $\mathbf{R}^{-1}$ appears in the update equation, not $\mathbf{R}$. While (as said before) $\mathbf{R}^{-1}$ can be computed from  $\mathbf{R}$ if one uses something like the membrane or bending energy, most LDDMM folks prefer to directly implement $\mathbf{R}^{-1}$ as a convolution with a Gaussian kernel (_i.e._, in other words, $\mathbf{R}^{-1}$ is the squared-exponential covariance matrix commonly used in Gaussian processes), even though that means no analytical expression for $\mathbf{R}$.
